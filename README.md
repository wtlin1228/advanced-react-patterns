# Advanced React Patterns

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.com/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```
